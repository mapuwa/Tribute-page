        <p>
            <strong>Mies van der Rohe</strong> was German-American architect. He, like many of his post-World War I
            contemporaries, sought to establish a <strong>new architectural style</strong> that could represent modern
            times just as Classical and Gothic did for their own eras. He created an influential twentieth-century
            architectural style, stated with <strong>extreme clarity and simplicity.</strong> His mature buildings made
            use of modern materials such as industrial steel and plate glass to define interior spaces. He strove toward
            an architecture with a minimal framework of structural order balanced against the implied freedom of
            unobstructed free-flowing open space. He called his buildings <strong>"skin and bones"</strong> architecture.

                    <p>
                        The Riehl House was <strong>Mies' first building</strong>. He was twenty-one at the time and was working for <strong>Bruno Paul</strong>.
                        Here, Mies reiterates much of Paul's classical German style with an <strong>austere stucco exterior</strong> and a pronounced
                        roof that emphasizes the idea of shelter and home. The interior space pulled inspiration from <strong>English cottages</strong>
                        and <strong>Japanese architecture</strong>, in addition to Paul.
