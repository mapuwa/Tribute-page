        <p>
            <strong>Mies van der Rohe</strong> was German-American architect. He, like many of his post-World War I
            contemporaries, sought to establish a <strong>new architectural style</strong> that could represent modern
            times just as Classical and Gothic did for their own eras. He created an influential twentieth-century
            architectural style, stated with <strong>extreme clarity and simplicity.</strong> His mature buildings made
            use of modern materials such as industrial steel and plate glass to define interior spaces. He strove toward
            an architecture with a minimal framework of structural order balanced against the implied freedom of
            unobstructed free-flowing open space. He called his buildings <strong>"skin and bones"</strong> architecture.

                    <h2>Riehl House</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Riehl House was <strong>Mies' first building</strong>. He was twenty-one at the time and was working for <strong>Bruno Paul</strong>.
                        Here, Mies reiterates much of Paul's classical German style with an <strong>austere stucco exterior</strong> and a pronounced
                        roof that emphasizes the idea of shelter and home. The interior space pulled inspiration from <strong>English cottages</strong>
                        and <strong>Japanese architecture</strong>, in addition to Paul.

                    <p>
                        Mies' big break came with the design for <strong>the German Pavilion</strong> at the 1929
                        <strong>World's Fair</strong>, held in <strong>Barcelona</strong>. Mies united sophisticated
                        materials with a fluid open plan, which together endowed the space with an unprecedented modern
                        elegance. The architecture's mass is balanced by a pond (featuring a <strong>sculpture by Georg
                        Kolb</strong>) and a shallow pool on either end.

                        Completed in Czechoslovakia in 1930, the Villa Tugendhat is today listed as a <strong>UNESCO</strong>
                        World Heritage Site and recently underwent an extensive two-year renovation. Mies designed the
                        house as well as most of the furnishings, including the <strong>Tugendhat Chair</strong>,
                        in production to this day.

                        The last house Mies designed for Germany before <strong>emigrating to the United States in 1938</strong>,
                        the Lemke House was completed in 1933 and the Lemke family lived there until forced out by the
                        Soviets in 1945. It later served as a janitor's house for the East German secret police.
                        Today, it has been renovated into gallery space. Unique is its courtyard. No other house by Mies
                        would feature this relation to green space.

                        columns</strong>—seems simple, but Mies worked through <strong>167</strong> drawings to come to
                        his final, fearless design. Like Einstein’s equation, its simplicity exudes an elegance through
                        a thorough attention to detail.

                        Hall</strong> is among the architect's masterpieces and was named a <strong>historic
                        landmark</strong> in 2001. The construction of this monumental building was beset by fire and
                        delays, and probably led to Mies' dismissal as director.

                        by <strong>Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Corporation</strong>, purveyors of Seagram liquors. Noted for
                        it's amber toned windows and public plaza, the Seagram is <strong>Mies' largest work</strong>.
                        The architect worked around <strong>New York City's</strong> zoning codes mandating that
                        skyscrapers recess or "set back" as they rose by recessing the entire building.

                        <strong>Opened in 1968</strong>, a year before <strong>Mies passed away</strong>, the New
                        National Gallery in <strong>Berlin</strong> cantilevers a primary exhibit hall over a glassy
                        central pavilion. The characteristic open interior space defies the traditional,
                        heavily-partitioned museum experience.

                        <strong>The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library</strong> evokes the solemnity of public

                        designed by Mies. Inside, stacks of books echo the rows of fluorescent lights. Outside, the sheer
                        mass of the structure is felt as it stretches down the city block. The project was completed
                        several years after Mies' death by his architecture firm.
