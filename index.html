        <p>
            Born in Germany in 1886, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe broke new ground with his architectural designs.
            He started out as a draftsman before striking out later on his own. During World War I, Mies
            served in the German military. Mies, like many of his post-World War I contemporaries, sought to establish
            a new architectural style that could represent modern times just as Classical and Gothic did for their own
            eras.
        </p>
        <p>
            He created an influential twentieth-century architectural style, stated with extreme clarity and
            simplicity. His mature buildings made use of modern materials such as industrial steel and plate glass to
            define interior spaces. He strove toward an architecture with a minimal framework of structural order
            balanced against the implied freedom of unobstructed free-flowing open space. He called his buildings
            "skin and bones" architecture.

            He became a well-known architect in Germany, creating such
            structures as the German Pavilion for the 1929 Barcelona Exposition. In the late 1930s, Mies
            emigrated to the United States. There he created such well-known Modernist works as the Lake Shore
            Drive Apartments and the Seagram Building. He  died on August 17, 1969. .
